    <section>
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Your safety and the protection of minors are our top priorities. This Privacy Policy explains what data BOLO bot (the “Bot”) collects, how it’s used, and your rights regarding that data. BOLO bot is hosted and operated in Salt Lake County, Utah, USA.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Data Collected</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Identifiers:</strong> Discord usernames, discriminators, and user IDs of individuals flagged as harmful to children.</li>
        <li><strong>Server Identifiers:</strong> Discord server IDs where the Bot is installed and flags are raised.</li>
        <li><strong>Flagging Metadata:</strong> Date/time of flagging, moderator or automated trigger source.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Purpose of Collection</h2>
      <p>We collect and store this information <strong>solely</strong> to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain a database of accounts verified to pose a risk to minors.</li>
        <li>Enforce bans across servers using the Bot to prevent further harm.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Legal Basis &amp; Consent</h2>
      <p>By installing or interacting with the Bot, server administrators agree to its data practices under Utah law. We assert a compelling legitimate interest: protecting minors from abuse.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Data Sharing &amp; Disclosure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>With Server Admins:</strong> Shared automatically to enforce bans.</li>
        <li><strong>With Third Parties:</strong> We do <strong>not</strong> sell or rent personal data. Only disclose in response to lawful requests (e.g., legal subpoenas issued within Utah or federal jurisdiction).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>Flagged‑user records are retained indefinitely to prevent repeat offenses. Should an error occur or a user prove their innocence, server admins may request removal via the contact information below.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Security Measures</h2>
      <p>We employ industry‑standard encryption at rest and in transit. Access to raw data is strictly limited to our Bot’s runtime environment in Salt Lake County; no human‑review panels exist to prevent misuse.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Bot’s purpose is to protect minors; it does not knowingly collect data <strong>about</strong> children except insofar as identifying predators.</li>
        <li>If a user believes their data was collected in error, they may request correction or deletion (see “Contact Us”).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access &amp; Correction:</strong> Request a copy or correction of data.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Submit a deletion request for records flagged incorrectly.</li>
        <li><strong>Objection:</strong> You may object to data processing, although this will disable the Bot’s protective functions for your server.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy to comply with Utah law or improve protections. We’ll notify server owners via an in‑Bot announcement before changes take effect.</p>
